HELLO Andrew, I tried to contact you via email (acb@dev.null.org, see below) but it does not seem to work.
I didn't want to get a Mastodon account so I am trying to contact you via this (unorthodox but quirky) way.
Please read below.
Rudy

=======================================================================================================
Hello, my name is Rudy.
I have downloaded the font that you created and I am using it in a book that I am writing.
I modified the font somewhat extensively but I would like to give you credit to you regardless:

"
FONT USED
ModeSevenEtN font 
Creator: acb, modified by Ceccato Rudy
License: Freely distributable

"

Can I include your email too?
What do you think?

I would like to also send you a copy of the book as the official payment for the free use of your font.
Hope this email still work.
If I do not hear back from you within 14 days, 
I will proceed with the credit as outlined above.

Best Regards,
Rudy
